# CountingTrees

To start the program, navigate to the TreeManager file in the terminal. Type "python3 TreeManager.py <Number of desired iterations>". My computer (a macbook) was able to handle 17-18 iterations, which translates to generating all trees of size 19 nodes or less. 
 
Upon executing, the the program will save the following information:
  - The number of non-isomorphic trees of a given size is saved in "tree_counts.csv".
  - For each set of trees generated, the models saves a distribution of the diameter size (longest path) in "tree_diameters.csv".
  - Similarly, for each set of trees generated, the model saves a distribution of the maximum degree in "tree_degrees.csv".
  - The distribution of number of leaves is saved in "tree_leaves.csv"
  
For ease of access, the results of these calculations are already saved and compiled as graphs in the excel document "Tree Graphs.xlsx".
